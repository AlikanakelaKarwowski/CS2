If obj1 and obj2 are both objects of a class that uses dynamic memory allocation, but the class does not have an assignment operator, what happens if you execute the following code?

What is wrong with the following definition of headinsert
struct
{
	int item;
	Node* link;
};
typedef Node*NodePtr;
void headInsert(NodePtr& head,int data)
{
NodePtr tmp = new Node;
tmp->item=data;
head->next=tmp;
tmp->next=head->next;
}
NodePtr head;
headInsert(head,4);

If there were any nodes following head they are now lost.
